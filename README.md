The repo contains some interesting data structures, algorithms and respective code challenges.

The challenges demonstrate possible and efficient approaches how to tackle different kind of algorithmic problems.

Many thanks goes to sources like InterviewCake, GeeksForGeeks, LeetCode, Techseries.dev etc. 
for providing the questions and other helpful resources.

Data structures:
- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Graphs
- Trees
- Tries
- Heaps
- Stack & Queues

Algorithms:
- Divide and conquer
- Dynamic programming
- Hashing
- Sorting and searching
- Greedy

The implementations are done in Java and for each solution some unit tests are provided.

This repo is a work in progress and will be extended with similar content.
