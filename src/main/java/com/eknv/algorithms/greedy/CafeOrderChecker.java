/**
 * My cake shop is so popular, I'm adding some tables and hiring wait staff so folks can have a cute sit-down cake-eating experience.
 * I have two registers: one for take-out orders, and the other for the other folks eating inside the cafe.
 * All the customer orders get combined into one list for the kitchen, where they should be handled first-come, first-served.
 * Recently, some customers have been complaining that people who placed orders after them are getting their food first.
 * Yikesâ€”that's not good for business!
 * <p>
 * To investigate their claims, one afternoon I sat behind the registers with my laptop and recorded:
 * The take-out orders as they were entered into the system and given to the kitchen. (takeOutOrders)
 * The dine-in orders as they were entered into the system and given to the kitchen. (dineInOrders)
 * Each customer order (from either register) as it was finished by the kitchen. (servedOrders)
 * <p>
 * Given all three arrays, write a method to check that my service is first-come, first-served.
 * All food should come out in the same order customers requested it.
 * <p>
 * We'll represent each customer order as a unique integer.
 * As an example,
 * Take Out Orders: [1, 3, 5]
 * Dine In Orders: [2, 4, 6]
 * Served Orders: [1, 2, 4, 6, 5, 3]
 * would not be first-come, first-served, since order 3 was requested before order 5 but order 5 was served first.
 * <p>
 * But,
 * Take Out Orders: [17, 8, 24]
 * Dine In Orders: [12, 19, 2]
 * Served Orders: [17, 8, 12, 19, 24, 2]
 * would be first-come, first-served.
 * <p>
 * Note: Order numbers are arbitrary. They do not have to be in increasing order.
