/**
 * Given a certain amount of floors of a building (say f number of floors)
 * and also given certain amount of eggs (say e number of eggs)
 * <p>
 * What is the least amount of egg drops one has to perform to find out the threshold floor?
 * <p>
 * Threshold floor is one from which the egg starts breaking and also egg breaks for all the floors above.
 * Also, if egg dropped from any floor below the threshold floor, it wonâ€™t break.
 * <p>
 * Constraints:
 * - An egg that survives a fall can be used again.
 * - A broken egg must be discarded.
 * - The effect of a fall is the same for all eggs.
 * - If an egg breaks when dropped, then it would break if dropped from a higher floor.
 * - If an egg survives a fall then it would survive a shorter fall.
 * <p>
